1.
Put all your files for this assignment into a directory called 
Homework#. The Homework# directory can have additional subdirectories, such as one called Question6. Do not put spaces in the 
directory name. I do not like spaces in directory names. In general, do 
not put spaces in filenames or directory names. I know Windows (and 
Mac) makes it easy to put spaces in filenames and directory names, but 
donâ€™t do it for this class. I will deduct points from your assignment
(this one an the following ones) if I must rename directories or files 
that have spaces in them.
2.
Change directory up one level above the Homework# directory.
3.
From the directory above Homework#, enter the following command. 
Where <yourname> is replaced with your onid/eecs login name (mine 
is chaneyr).
tar cvfj Homework#-<yourname>.tar.bzip Homework#
In my case, I would create a single tar.bzip file named 
Homework#-chaneyr.tar.bzip

exract with tar xvfj
