atomicity
race conditions
file descriptors, open files, on disk blocks

first half of ch. 5

atomic operations
there are a couple of variables

deposit
A                        B
read balance            read balance
read deposit            read deposit
add balance, deposit    add balance, deposit
write back balance      write back balance

there is a diference between teh serial case and the parallel case

if parallel, then A transaction might not update before B transaction.

RACE CONDITION
order of operations dictate the end result
order of operations must be independant of final result - atomic operation
add balance and write back as one step
a cannot interupt b and b cannot interupt a

atomic operations either completely succede or completely fail
