bugs found in assignment 3

*id:  scorefor001 
bug description:
	In scoreFor(), when computing the score from deck the code was:
	//score from deck
	for (i = 0; i < state->discardCount[player]; i++) 

	It has been fixed to be:
	//score from deck
	for (i = 0; i < state->deckCount[player]; i++) 
	
found by running:
	unittest3, test 1, asserted on line 86 due to player 1 score != 3, this is because the cards in the deck 
	were not counted

status: bug has been fixed in dominion.c code

*id:  scorefor002
bug description:
	The score for the garden card is calculated incorrectly.  The score for each garden card is one point for every
	10 cards that the player has.  So instead of calculating it separately for discard, deck and hand cards, it is 
	based on the total cards.
	
found by running:
	unittest3, test 2, asserted on 106 because the score for player 1 is 13 instead of 14.  This is because the 
	score for the garden card (1 point) was not added.
	
status: bug has been fixed in dominion.c code

*id:  smithy001
bug description:
	After the smithy is played the trashFlag is set to 1 (to trash it) instead of 0 (to discard it).

found by running:
	cardtest1, test 1, asserted on line 57 because the expected number of discarded cards did not equal the 
	calculated number 
	
status:  bug has been fixed temporarily so that the unittestresults.out file can be run for assignment 3	


*id:  adventurer001
bug description:
	When cards are drawn, silver cards do not count as treasure cards.  
	
found by running:
	cardtest2, test 3, asserted on line 93 because more cards were drawn from the deck than expected
	
status:  bug has been fixed temporarily so that the unittestresults.out file can be run for assignment 3

*id:  adventurer002 (submitted 11/1/2014)

found by running:
