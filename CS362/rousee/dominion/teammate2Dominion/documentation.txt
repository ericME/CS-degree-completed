Documentation for smithy, adventurer, discardCard() and updateCoins()

*smithy card* 

The smithy card is an action card and can be bought for 4 coins.  When the smithy is played,
the player draws three cards.

The code for smithy has already been refactored.  The zzzsmithycardplay function has a for loop 
that calls the drawCard function three times.  The function then calls discardCard to discard 
the smithy card.

*adventurer card*

The adventurer card is an action card that can be bought for 6 coins. When the adventurer card is
played, cards are revealed from the players deck until two treasure cards are revealed. The treasure
cards are placed in the player's hand but all of the other revealed cards are discarded.

The code for adventurer has already been refactored.  The zzzadventurecardplay function  
first has a while loop that runs until there are two treasure cards drawn.  In the while 
loop if the deck is empty the discard pile is shuffled and added to the player's deck, then a card is
drawn using drawCard.  The variable cardDrawn is set to the top card.  If cardDrawn is a treasure card
then drawntreasure is incremented by 1, if not, the top card is removed and z (the count of the
non-treasure cards) is incremented by 1.  When the first while loop is complete the function loops
through the revealed cards and discards them. 
 
*discardCard()*

The discardCard() function removes a card from the player's hand and places it in the played pile or
removes it from the game. First it checks to see if the trashFlag is set. If it is not the card is added 
to the played pile.  If it is set then the played card is set to -1.  Then there is an if statement that
checks if the card is the last card in the player's hand or if the player only has one card in their hand. 
If either is true then the handCount is decremented by 1.  Else the discarded card is swapped with the last
card and the handCount is decremented by 1.  At the end of the function 0 is returned.

*updateCoins()*

This method first sets the number of coins (state->coins) that the player has to zero.  It then loops
through each card in the player's hand and adds 1 to state->coins if the card is copper, adds 2 to 
state->coins if the card is silver, and adds 3 to state->coins if the card is gold.  Finally it adds any
bonus number to state->coins and returns 0.
