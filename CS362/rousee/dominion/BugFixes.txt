Bugs teammates found:
1. When smithy card is played, four cards are drawn instead of three.
2. When council_room card is played, number of buys is 1 instead of 2.
3. Playing the council room card results in number of buys being one less than it should be.
4. Playing the village card results in an incorrect number of actions.
