
To be thorough in listing this all over for those who have exams soon (I thought I posted this Wednesday afternoon or evening):

The list of topics is (mostly in this order, but not all are covered):
Declaration and instantiation of an object
Some Java specific concepts such as encapsulation, abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism
A little code writing (does not need to compile, just needs to be the right idea) of constructors and other methods
Design of a piece of code (no bodies of code, just stubs)
JUnit testing (design and implementation of tests)
A little debugging (some terms used in the debugging lab and lecture)
and an extra credit question on recursion (the required question got moved to the final, so be ready for it)
